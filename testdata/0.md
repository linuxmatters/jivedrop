Hello friends!

We've got the band back together, and we're excited to announce the launch of our new podcast, Linux Matters. We'll be here every two weeks, talking about the impact Linux has on our daily lives. While the podcast is new, our voices might be familiar to you. Linux Matters is brought to you by the minds and voices behind the Ubuntu Podcast.

Join us for some upbeat family-friendly banter, conversation and discussion for Linux enthusiasts and casual observers of all ages. We'll be covering terminal productivity, desktop apps, self-hosting, Linux hardware and devices, community management, gaming, development and all the Linux Matters that matter.
